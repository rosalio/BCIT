On May 11, 1997, the machine, with human intervention between games, won the second six-game match against world champion Garry Kasparov, two to one, with three draws. Kasparov accused IBM of cheating and demanded a rematch. IBM refused and retired Deep Blue. Kasparov had beaten a previous version of Deep Blue in 1996.
