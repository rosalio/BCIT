Below is alternative turtle commands that you can use when testing your solution.  I do not recommend testing with the commands below until you have your solution working with my original commands. I am not supplying an image for the commands below so it will be a surprise when you execute it :)

The commands below were supplied to me by a former student - KJ.  If you would like to supply me an interesting alternative command array, I will include it with future iterations of this assignment, as I am now doing with the commands that KJ provided me.
