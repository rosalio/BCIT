	<h2>About Me</h2>
	
	<img class="contentimage" src="./img/alex.jpg" height = "220" alt="alex.jpg">
	<p>Hello, welcome to my homepage! My name is Alex Dai. I was born in Shanghai, China
	and moved to Vancouver in 2008. After studying and working here for a few years, I 
	really fell in love with this beautiful city. In December 2013, I became a permanent 
	resident of Canada. </p>	 
	
	<p>
	After graduating from Simon Fraser University with a M.A.Sc degree in 2013, I have 
	been working as a software developer. I am really interested to solve technical problems 
	and discover the unknown.</p>
	
	<p>When I am not working, I love traveling and enjoy reading detective novels. One of 
	my favorite is the Hercule Poirot series by Agatha Christie. I am also a big fan of 
	soccer and a very big fan of Lionel Messi.</p>

	<p>To contact me, please feel free to send me an email at:
