		<h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
			<blockquote>
			<p>Welcome to my homepage! My name is Alex Dai and I am a part-time student
			 at BCIT. I had a degree in electrical engineering and worked as a software 
			 developer for a few years before moving to Vancouver. I love traveling and 
			 enjoy reading novels. My favorite is the Hercule Poirot series by Agatha 
			 Christie. I am a big fan of soccer and a very big fan of Lionel Messi. </p>

		<h2><strong>Why Taking COMP 1850?</strong></h2>
			<blockquote>
			<p>I'm very interested to learn how to build front-end web pages to present 
			good technical and business ideas. I believe from this entry-level course I 
			will obtain	many fundamental knowledge of web development so that I can go 
			further in future. Besides, I am also seeking an opportunity to complete the 
			CST program and this course is the very first step along the journey.
