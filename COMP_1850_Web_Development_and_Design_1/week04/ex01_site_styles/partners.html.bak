<img src="images/partners.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="" class="contentimage">Our current partners are a bunch of hard-working, gullible stiffs, who really got shafted by our lawyers. Unfortunately for them, they're locked into a long-term deal that gives us the right to exploit their capabilities and intellectual property with little need for compensation. We're rolling in dough over here, I tell you.
</p>

<p>
In any case, they should consider themselves lucky that we even deigned to mention them here on our spiffy, high-end web offering.

Where possible, we have linked to our partners' web sites. If they don't have one, then they probably have something to hide. Unlike us. We're very open...really.
